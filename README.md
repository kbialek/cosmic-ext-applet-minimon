# Minimon COSMIC Applet

A configurable applet for displaying the following:
* CPU load
* System load averages (1, 5 and 15 minutes)
* CPU temperature
* Memory usage
* Network utilization
* Disk activity
* GPU and VRAM usage on Nvidia and AMD GPUs. 

Can sit in the panel or Dock. Configurable refresh rate and many display options.

Enable System Load in the applet settings to show its values, chart, or both.
The values show the 1-, 5-, and 15-minute load averages; the chart shows all
three averages in distinct, configurable colors with a shared adaptive scale. System Load is disabled by default.

## Chart types

Every sensor offers the charts it can draw in its `Chart type` dropdown:

* **Ring** - a ring filled to the current reading.
* **Line** - the recent history as a line.
* **Heat** - the recent history as a cold-to-hot gradient (temperatures).
* **Bars** - one stacked bar per CPU core, user and system time in their own colors (CPU).
* **Vertical bar** - one bar per reading, filled from the bottom to its current
  value: load, temperature between the minimum and the critical one, memory in
  use. Sensors with two readings in one chart (download and upload, write and
  read, used and allocated memory) draw two bars side by side. It uses the line
  chart's colors: the first fills the bar, the second paints the track of a
  single bar.

## Chart width

Each sensor draws its chart at the width the panel gives it. The `Chart width`
setting of a sensor takes a percentage of that room, from 25% to 100%, so a
sensor whose chart is only a gauge can be given half the width it would
otherwise take. The chart is redrawn at the chosen width - it is squeezed
sideways, keeping its height, rather than cut off - and the panel shrinks with
it.

## Label orientation

The labels of the sensors (`CPU`, `TEMP`, `MEM`, `NET`, `DISK`, `GPU`, `LOAD`) are
printed left to right. `Label orientation` in the general settings can print
them top to bottom instead: one character below the next, with the characters
themselves upright - a label that stands up rather than one turned sideways -
which trades width for height. A standing label is printed small enough to fit
the height of the chart next to it, so it never makes the panel taller.

## Installing

### Flatpak

Depending on how you've installed COSMIC Desktop, Minimon may show up in your app store by default. In COSMIC Store it should be under the "COSMIC Applets" category.

If Minimon does not show up in your app store, you'll need to add `cosmic-flatpak` as a source:
```sh
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user cosmic https://apt.pop-os.org/cosmic/cosmic.flatpakrepo
```

Then, proceed to your preferred app store and search for Minimon.

### From package manager

If on a .deb based distibution download [latest version](https://github.com/cosmic-utils/minimon-applet/releases) and install with the following commands:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i <name_of.deb>
```

### Post-installation

Once it is installed, it should show up in cosmic settings when modifying the applets on the dock or panel.

It can also be launched as a conventional application from the terminal using:
```sh
flatpak run io.github.cosmic_utils.minimon-applet
```
or launched on desktop environments outside of COSMIC. It only functions as an applet on COSMIC Desktop, however.

## Building

To build the applet, you will need [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and probably xkbcommon, if you're on Pop!\_OS, you can install it with the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install just libxkbcommon-dev
```

Run the following commands to build and install the applet:

```sh
just build-release
just install
```

Alternatively generate a deb or rpm file for installation:

```sh
just build-release
just deb
just rpm
```
and install with:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i <name_of.deb>
sudo dnf install <name_of.rpm>
```

For checking logs:

```sh
journalctl SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=cosmic-ext-applet-minimon
```
